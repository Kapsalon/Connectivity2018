## Expectations and desired learning outcomes

Here's a neat table of things I expect from the hands-on tutorials:

Objective / Expectation | Why? | How important / exciting is it for me (1-10)
 --- | --------- | :-----: |
 Basics of connectivity and state of the art research | I'm trying to pursue a future career in neuroscience | 10 |
 Acquire new skills in statistical analysis | It's pretty damn crucial | 10 |
 Practice my tech very primitive tech skills | First time using GIT, first time using Matlab for a uni course | 6 |
 Writing / data presentation skills | Just starting to realize table was a bad idea for this info | 4 |
 
 ## Final words
 
 I think the brain is kind of amazing. Here's one of the funniest pop-cult representations of it, that has nothing to do with neuroscience whatsoever:
